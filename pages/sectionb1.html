            <h2>Characteristics:</h2>
            <h4> More Precision: </h4>
            <p> Intermediate learners work on improving their precision with finer strokes,
                learning how to balance pressure and angle when using more advanced tools like nib pens or brushes.
            </p>
    
            <h4> Introduction of Serifs:</h4>
            <p> At this stage, learners can begin experimenting with serifs and more intricate letter
                details, which add a decorative touch to the letters.</p>
    
            <h4> Finer Tools:</h4>
            <p>The use of nib pens or brush pens becomes more prevalent. These tools require more control
                than beginner pens but allow for greater flexibility in creating fine details.</p>
    
            <h4> Understanding Flourishes: </h4>
            <p>Learners also start incorporating decorative flourishes or embellishments to their letters,
                focusing on balance and spacing. </p>
    
            <h4> Examples of Intermediate Styles:</h4>
            <p>Also known as Blackletter, this style is characterized by its angular and rigid letters.
                It is more challenging than Italic due to the precision required for the sharp, straight strokes and
                intricate
                design.</p>
    
            <h4> Uncial Script:</h4>
            <p> A medieval script with rounded strokes, Uncial offers an intermediate challenge.
                Its curved letters are ideal for learners who want to move beyond the more straightforward
                forms of Italic or Print Script. </p>
    
            <h4> Copperplate Script:</h4>
            <p>Copperplate is an elegant, cursive style known for its flowing, connected strokes.
                It requires a keen eye for detail and precision, making it more complex than modern calligraphy.
